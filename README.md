## Sequence Memory Game

A console based sequence memory game developed in C# and is based on the console.
## How to Play

1. The game will show you a sequence of numbers, one by one.
2. After a short pause, you will need to enter the sequence in the same order.
3. If you enter the correct sequence, the game will proceed to the next round, and one additional number will be added to the sequence.
4. If you enter the wrong sequence, the game will display an "Incorrect" message and ask for the correct sequence again.
5. The game continues indefinitely with the sequence getting longer after each round until you choose to stop playing.
